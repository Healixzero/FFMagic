Prime Fire

Ignition:
    Cost: 1 Mana
    Range: Engaged      Duration: 1 round       Amount: 1 Match's worth     Damage: 1
    For 1 Mana, create either an instantaneous, violent spark (like that created by sparking the leads of a car battery) or a persistent flame of size [AMOUNT} is 
    created. The spark or flame is always created at engaged range to the caster, but may continue to exist, assuming that it is withing [RANGE] of the caster. Once
    the flame goes beyond [RANGE] of the caster, it is treated like normal fire: without adequate fuel, it will burn itself out. With adequate fuel, the fire will last 
    indefineately, and should be treated as non-magic. Beginning to channel another spell, or making an attack with the created flame/spark causes the flame/spark to be
    consumed.  Spells used to make ranged attacks can be made against any target within [RANGE] range of the caster as a "Ranged (light)" attack. If flames created via 
    "Igntion" are made against targets beyond [RANGE] range, the attack automatically fails, and the Mana associated with the spell are discarded. Fire lit by a "spark"
    created by "Ignition" is treated as non-magical fire, it cannot be controled by a mage, nor can any attributes be added to it. If a player takes damage during the 
    channeling of a spell they are required to make a disciple check [1 difficulty per 2 damage taken]; failure of the check results in the spell being cancelled, and 
    all the Mana associated with the spell is discarded. A number of modifications equal to or less than the the caster's "Mage Rank" can be applied to a spell.
